# DontCloseWindowWithLastTab
Prevent closing of Google Chrome with the last tab, the least intrusive way.

It keeps a single pinned page to prevent closing Chrome when the last tab of the last window is closed (or every window, it's configurable). To keep the tab bar clean (unlike other extensions), the pinned page is inserted only when absolutely necessary. It also handles well cases when tabs are moved between windows.

Find this extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dont-close-window-with-la/dlnpfhfhmkiebpnlllpehlmklgdggbhn) or [Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/feebepaidmpgnkpngmeldoooofaacbhi).
